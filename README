Originally imported via
git svn clone -r 889024:1073916 --no-minimize-url https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openjpa/eclipse/trunk openjpa-eclipse
according to http://help.github.com/svn-importing/, because GitHub SVN Import didn't work (too big?)
History lost I think, but it doesn't matter, there wasn't much anyway.
