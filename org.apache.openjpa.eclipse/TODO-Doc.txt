These are some rough notes on what kind of doc should be written up on some e.g. Wiki page once this is accepted and published:

* Installation

* Usage

* Configuration via .project:
	<buildCommand>
			<name>org.apache.openjpa.eclipse.OpenJPAEnhancerBuilder</name>
			<arguments>
				<dictionary>
					<key>debugLogs</key>
					<value>false</value>
				</dictionary>
				<dictionary>
					<key>include1</key>
					<value>**/*Entity.class</value>
				</dictionary>
				<dictionary>
					<key>include2</key>
					<value>**/*EntityRef.class</value>
				</dictionary>

* debugLogs true causes stuff to show up in the Error Log view, but it
seems to slow things down and something goes wrong with the Progress view and the Monitor stuff,
it doesn't update correctly anymore, and keeps running.  So only intended for investigating problems.

* DOC: No support for persistence.xml, only based on @Entity Annotations

*  see http://people.apache.org/~ppoddar/eclipse/

* FAQ / Troubleshooting
	* something like "-XX:PermSize=64m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xms128m -Xmx512m" is typically needed...

* OpenJPA documentation chapter on enhancement should reference this plug-in/doc?

* Link from http://webspherepersistence.blogspot.com/2009/02/openjpa-enhancement.html

* Known Limitations / Ideas for Extensions
	* persistence.xml instead annotations
	
	* Builder must not run on / skip classes which are red / have other compilation issues.. (is there a .class file in these cases? apparently.. or is that a left-over?)
	 
	* Error Marker is on .class resource (normal..), how can we make it on the 'corresponding' (?) .java instead?
	
	* Adding supported enhancement flags (e.g. -addDefaultConstructor etc.) in a preference page.
